## Context

Spallian Blog is a simple, secured blog with an administrator and a regular user:

|        email        |   password   |
|---------------------|--------------|
|  admin@contact.com  |   admin123   |
|  user@contact.com   |   user123    |
|  user2@contact.com  |   user456    |

## Objective

The goal is to implement the functionalities to see the list of articles, show and delete a specific article.

The administrator can delete any of the existing articles, but the user cannot.

*Bonus:*

Anything regarding the design of the blog is up to you, from CSS to JavaScript and their libraries/frameworks. **It is not mandatory though.**

Any additional feature (bundle, functionality, logic, best practice and so on) is welcomed.
